How the Excercise was achieved:

    1. A little bit of HTML and CSS was used to structure and design the interface.
    2. Javascript DOM was used to give the interface some functionality like assigning function to the button like telling it what to do 
       when been clicked.
    3. The content searched and it number of appearance is displayed.
    4. Input addEventListener is used on the buttons.
